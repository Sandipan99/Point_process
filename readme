This project contains implementation of point processes (i) Poisson process, (ii) Univariate Hawkes process and (iii) Multivariate Hawkes process

Multivariate hawkes process uses Armadillo library (http://arma.sourceforge.net/) and hence its installation is necessary. 

Likewise likelihood estimation part requires dlib library (http://dlib.net/)

For univariate Hawkes: 
I have had success fitting mu and alpha by maximizing the MLE with LBFGS. The log-likelihood is not concave in beta though, so you can simply iterate over a range of beta values and pick the one with the maximum likelihood. Note that alpha<beta is required for stationarity of the process.

param_estimate_univar_hawkes.py uses Nelder-Mead algorithm to obtain a better estimation for univariate case.
